CxxUtil a toolbox for C++
=========================

The main idea behind CxxUtil is to collect more or less
general-purpose code for use in C++ programs without copying
and pasting code from module to module. Fell free to add own 
classes and/or utility functions to the library.


THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE!
======================

The code has been in use for a while now and can thus be considered
fairly stable. Still it is of course not free of bugs! If you use 
this software you know what you are doing. I am not responsible for 
any damage it does to your system.
